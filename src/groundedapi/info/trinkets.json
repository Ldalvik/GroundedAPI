Only the bonus hit can proc other effects that are specific to certain weapon types. As an example, if you were to equip a single piece of bee armor which has a 100% chance to add 3 stun to your bow shots, that 3 stun would not apply on every hit you do, it would ONLY be applied to the bonus hit when it procs (25% of the time). This trinket also does not work with Whittle Wizard as this trinket does not have the appropriate type tags.

"Sticky Fingers: Gives your melee hits a 10% chance to steal an item from the enemy's loot table. After 1 item is stolen the robbed enemy becomes immune to stealing from Sticky Fingers indefinitely (i.e., until death/despawn and respawn).
