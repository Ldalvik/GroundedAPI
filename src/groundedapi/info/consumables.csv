Meal Mechanics:
"You can only have one well fed buff at a time. The well fed buff is stronger from higher tier meals, ranging from T0 up to T3."
"Generally speaking you can only have 1 additional food effect in addition to well fed. However, there is a fairly complicated exception that I discovered that does allow limited meal stacking depending on the order you eat the meals."

"There are two categories of buffs, you can have 1 buff from each category at the same time:"
"--Category 1 (C1): Swim Speed, Junior Breath (T1), Critical Chance, Attack Stamina, Fall Damage, Reflect Damage, Grass Harvest Damage, Damage Reduction, Poison Damage Reduction, Dust resistance/immunity."
"--Category 2 (C2): Max health, Rock Harvest Damage, Veteran Breath (T3), Sizzle Reduction, Exhaustion time reduction, Stamina Regeneration."

"When you gain a new food buff it replaces the previous food buff from that same category. The way to stack buffs is to eat a T3 meal first followed by a T1/T2 meal, this allows you to keep the category 2, T3 buff and stack a category 1, T1/T2 buff on top of it. Your well fed buff will also be replaced with the tier of the last meal consumed, so it will be downgraded from T3 to T1/T2 in the process."

Examples:
"If you eat a Black Ox burger which gives Max Health (C2) and Damage Reduction (C1) and then eat a Spider Slider which gives Critical Chance (C1), it will replace the damage reduction (C1) leaving you with BOTH max health and critical chance."
"If you eat a Quesadillantlion which provides Reflect Damage (C1) and Sizzle Reduction (C2) and then consume a Miteloaf with gives Attack Stamina (C1), it will replace the Reflect Damage leaving you with BOTH Sizzle Reduction and Attack Stamina."
"Last example because it's a curve ball: If you eat a Tadpoloca Pudding which provides Swim Speed (C1) and Veteran Breath (C2) and then consume a Spaghetflea which gives Junior Breath (C1), it will replace the Swim Speed leaving you with BOTH the Junior Breath and Veteran Breath bonuses. Even though they're both breath bonuses, they're separate bonuses from different categories so they will stack."
Here is a short video demonstrating how this works and clearly shows that limited meal stacking is possible. https://youtu.be/Jprfb8P7oz8

Here's a simple rule to remember: Always pick the T3(C2) buff you want first and eat that T3 meal first. After that eat the T1/T2 meal with the C1 buff that you want. That will leave you with 1 T3 buff and 1 T1/T2 buff.

Items:
Shinobi Sneeze:
"Throw a smoke bomb at your feet that causes 5 AoE stun damage to enemies and creates a pollen cloud that lingers for 10 seconds, slowing enemies by 25% for 1 second and reapplies for as long as the enemy remains in the cloud."
"Additionally, throwing the bomb damages you for 20 health and reduces all damage you deal by 80% for 5 seconds. This effect also turns you invisible for 5 seconds or until you attack."
[Note: I tested this in game and the cloud might not be triggering properly. It's the same cloud used by the Bee Armor set and it is incredibly buggy with that set as well. The pollen VFX goes off because that is tied to the bomb throw itself. The pollen cloud does not seem to spawn and slow enemies.]
